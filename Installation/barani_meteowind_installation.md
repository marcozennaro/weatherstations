![](/en/Documentation/Installation/images/meteowind01.png)

The MeteoWind Pro wireless anemometer & wind vane is composed of the two
wind sensors and an electronic module containing a photovoltaic panel,
battery and LoRaWAN radio, connected with a cable.

Care should be taken to minimize shade over the solar panel that would
reduce its efficiency.

Furthermore, for long range transmission the transmitter box should be
as high as possible and in the direction of the gateway that one wants
to reach.

The L-bracket must be secured with bolts or stainless steel hose clamps
to the supporting mast.

Open the bottom of the box by loosening the four big plastic bolts with
a flat screwdriver to expose the electronic board, and make sure that
the switch is off.

Insert the cable through the box cable gland and connect the four wires
with the following scheme: Brown - VCC, White - Ground, Yellow - Wind
direction, Green - Wind Speed.

Turn on the switch. A red LED will lit. Put back the bottom of the box
taking care that the green wire (the antenna) is in a vertical position.
Tighten the plastic bolts.
